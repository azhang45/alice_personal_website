        <p id="short-intro">Hi! Iâ€™m Alice, a first year student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems
             with a minor in Music Technology. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, so I visited the NASA Johnson 
             Space center there many times and fell in love with space and technology. After 5th grade I moved to 
             New Jersey in which I now take visits to Flushing for food or Manhattan for the skyline.</p>

        <p id="long-intro">
            My interest in programming started from coding Lego robotics and developing games using Scratch in elementary school. 
            From there, I have programmed autonomous trajectories and computer vision pipelines for robots, created 
            games in Unity, and developed full-stack web applications. Along the way, I have also picked up soft skills 
            such as communication, cross-team collaboration, and more. Aside from software development, many of my 
            hobbies lie at the intersection between technology and art: theater tech (audio engineering and lighting design), 
            building custom mechanical keyboards, songwriting/music production, etc.
