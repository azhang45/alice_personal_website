        <p id="intro">Hi! Iâ€™m Alice, a first year student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems
             with a minor in Music Technology. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas, so I visited the NASA Johnson 
             Space center there many times and fell in love with space and technology. After 5th grade I moved to 
             New Jersey in which I now take visits to Flushing for food or Manhattan for the skyline. My interest in 
             programming started from coding Lego robotics and developing games using Scratch in elementary school. 
             From there, I have programmed autonomous trajectories and computer vision pipelines for robots, created 
             games in Unity, and developed full-stack web applications. Along the way, I have also picked up soft skills 
             such as communication, cross-team collaboration, and more. Aside from software development, many of my 
             hobbies lie at the intersection between technology and art: theater tech (audio engineering and lighting design), 
             building custom mechanical keyboards, songwriting/music production, etc.</p>
